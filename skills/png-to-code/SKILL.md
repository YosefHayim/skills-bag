description: Convert a PNG design into pixel-perfect code — SVG illustrations/logos, HTML/CSS UI, and animations — using a decompose → reuse-or-build → render → screenshot-diff → refine loop that measurably converges to a 1:1 match instead of eyeballing. Use when the user provides a PNG, screenshot, mockup, or inspiration image and wants it turned into SVG, HTML/CSS, a web component, or an animated illustration, or asks to match a design "pixel-perfect" / "1:1".

# PNG → Pixel-Perfect Code

Reproduce a PNG (illustration, logo, UI screen, or full mockup) as code that matches the original **1:1**. Go slowly: build one region at a time and **re-measure after every change**. The agent reaches pixel-perfect the same way a designer did with a PerfectPixel overlay — except the overlay is a **measured pixel diff**, not a human eye.

## Ground rule

**The diff score is the source of truth.** Never call something "done" or "1:1" from looking at it. Render it, screenshot it, diff it against the target PNG with `scripts/src/core/pixel-diff.ts`, and drive the mismatch ratio toward zero. If you cannot measure it, say so plainly.

## The loop

Step 0 runs once at the start; repeat steps 4–6 until converged.

0. **Intake — align on intent before measuring.** A PNG is one frozen frame; what the user wants in *motion* and *fidelity* is not in the pixels, so ask (a short `AskUserQuestion` is ideal). Cover: static reproduction or animated? if animated, which parts move and how big a gesture (subtle idle vs hero wave)? strict 1:1, or "inspired-by / make it prettier"? reduced-motion fallback? And **proactively suggest the life a static PNG cannot depict** — most often a living/animated background (drifting aurora, floating blobs) — and confirm the vibe before building. Never infer animation scope from a still. → `reference/decompose.md` (§0)
1. **Frame** — read target dimensions with `scripts/src/core/inspect-png.ts`. The render viewport is the target's pixel size.
2. **Decompose** — split the image into ordered regions; mark each *raster* (export/slice) vs *reproducible in code* (CSS/SVG). Extract exact specs (color, type, spacing). **If anything will animate, plan the rig now** — decompose into the skeleton of named, joint-pivoted, parented parts before acquiring geometry. → `reference/decompose.md`, `reference/rigging.md`
3. **Reuse or build** — search existing SVG libraries first and customize; trace or hand-build only the gap. For animated parts, build to rig (**reuse > hand-build > per-part masked trace > never one flat trace**). → `reference/svg-illustration.md`, `reference/rigging.md`
4. **Build one region** — structural/largest first. Match the target repo's stack; if none, vanilla HTML/CSS/SVG. Order within a region: layout → typography → color → effects.
5. **Measure** — run the diff. Read the ratio and the **hotspot grid** (where the biggest differences are). → `reference/verification.md`
6. **Refine** — fix the single biggest hotspot, re-run. One change per iteration so each diff is attributable. Continue until `ratio < 0.1%` — or improvements stall, then report the number.
7. **Optimize + animate last** — SVGO the vectors (`scripts/svgo.config.mjs`); add animation only after the static match holds and (for figures) the rig passes its crux test. → `reference/animation.md`

## Stack detection (step 4)

Detect before writing code, in order: (1) the target repo's framework/styling (`package.json`, existing components, Tailwind / CSS modules / styled-components) → match it; (2) no repo or greenfield → framework-agnostic **vanilla HTML + CSS + inline SVG**. Add a library (GSAP, Lottie, anime.js) only for a concrete need (complex morph, After-Effects export) and note why near the import.

## Reuse before building (step 3)

Always check for an existing vector before tracing: SVGRepo, unDraw, Heroicons, Feather, Phosphor, Lucide, Iconify, Noun Project. Recolor/resize to match. Trace (potrace / AutoTrace / Inkscape) only what you cannot find, then simplify nodes. Details + sources in `reference/svg-illustration.md`.

## First-time setup (verification harness)

The diff loop needs Node. From the skill's `scripts/`:

```
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Then, per iteration (from `scripts/`):

```
npx tsx src/core/pixel-diff.ts --target design.png --input build/index.html
```

Or: `npm run diff -- --target design.png --input build/index.html`

If Node/Playwright is unavailable, use the manual overlay method in `reference/verification.md` and state the match is eyeballed, not measured.

## Convergence checklist

- [ ] Confirmed intent first (static vs animated, fidelity bar, optional living enhancements) — not inferred from the still
- [ ] Viewport set to the target's exact pixel dimensions
- [ ] Fonts loaded and animations frozen before each screenshot
- [ ] Fixed the biggest hotspot, not random tweaks
- [ ] One change per measured iteration
- [ ] Reported the final mismatch ratio honestly (no unmeasured 1:1 claims)
