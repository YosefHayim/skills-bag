/**
 * The feature catalog: the authoritative description of every installable unit

 * here, so adding a feature (or moving a hook to a new event) is a one-place
 * change. Dependencies are resolved by {@link resolveFeatures} so that, e.g.,
 * asking for `autonomous-loop` always also pulls `context-guard` (they share
 * WARN_PCT and the daemon relies on the guard's wind-down contract).
