/**
 * `skills-bag dedup check [path]` — the runnable side of the dedup-guard feature.
 *
 * The live hooks block duplicates as they're written (Claude) or warn after the
 * fact (Cursor); this command is the catch-all that works EVERYWHERE, including
 * agents that can't hook a file edit at all (Codex). It runs the same AST engine
 * over a repo and exits non-zero on findings, so it serves three jobs from one
 * place: an advisory tool an agent/user can run, a git pre-commit check
 * (`--staged`), and a CI gate on a PR diff (`--since <ref>`). A duplicate can't
 * silently merge even where a hook couldn't stop it.
 *
 * Like the hooks, it resolves the repo's own `typescript`; a repo without it is
 * reported as un-checkable (exit 0) rather than failed, so non-TS repos don't
 * break CI.
